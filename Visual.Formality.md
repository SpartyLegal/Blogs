###Coding Advocacy: Visualizing Supreme Court Arguments and Formality

Recently, Professor Josh Blackman generously entertained a question of mine regarding semantic analysis of Supreme Court oral arguments. I’m especially interested in how the justices’ questions correlate, if at all, to the way they vote and a case’s outcome. Following this conversation, I looked into the question a bit more and some creative ways of studying oral argument. I found this fantastic post from the Tyler Rinker’s blog demonstrating Rinker’s R package qdap’s power and flexibility for dialogue analysis. I thought I’d give it a try on a Supreme Court oral argument.
