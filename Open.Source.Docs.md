Three Benefits of Open Source Legal Docs
=========================================
In my last post, I discussed how open-source software could potentially be used as an alternative to expensive TAR platforms or, even worse, teams of associate attorneys to review and organize large bodies of documents. Open source principles are not, however, limited to software or computers. In fact, “the concept of free sharing of technological information existed long before computers. For example, cooking recipes have been shared and remixed since the beginning of human culture.” So it should come as no surprise that organizations are applying open source principles to disciplines beyond software and computers.

The legal industry, despite its often cited resistance to change, is no exception.
